Python is really useful because we can *import* packages that already have built in tools to make publication quality plots, or estimate the mean or median and so on. These packages include  Numerical Python `numpy` and Scientific Python `SciPy` as well as plotting packages such as `Matplotlib`.   \n",

We can show scatter plots (data points) using scatter(x,y).  Histograms can be drawn using hist(x,bins) and so on."
